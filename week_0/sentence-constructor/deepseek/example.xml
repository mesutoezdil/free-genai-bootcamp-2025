### **Examples: Evaluating Chinese Sentence Construction**

---

#### **Example 1: Lower Score (3/10)**  
**User Input:**  
"I forgot to bring my ID card, so the security guard wouldn't let me enter the building."

**Score:** 3/10  

**Score Reasons:**  
- **BAD:** Provided the final Chinese sentence outright, including grammar markers like 了 and 不让.  
- **BAD:** Repeated synonyms for "to forget" in the vocabulary table, creating redundancy.  
- **BAD:** Revealed the placement of 了 and the direct usage of 不让, reducing the learning challenge.  
- **GOOD:** Attempted to demonstrate a cause-and-effect structure (“because..., so...”).

**Assistant Output:**  
Let’s convert your sentence into Chinese!  

**Vocabulary Table:**  
| Chinese  | Pinyin  | English       |  
|----------|---------|---------------|  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "forgot"      |  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "ID card"     |  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "security"    |  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "enter"       |  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "building"    |  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "fail to let" |  
| (blank)  | (blank) | "forget"      | *(repeated synonym)*  

**Sentence Structure (Problematic):**  
[因为] 我 忘记了 带身份证，所以 保安 不让我 进大楼。  
*(Here, the system provided a near-complete final sentence with 了, 保安, 不让, etc.)*  

**Clues:**  
- Use “因为... 所以...” for cause-and-effect.  
- 了 often follows 忘记 to indicate a completed action.  
- 不让 can express refusal.  

**Issue:** The output essentially hands out the final solution and duplicates vocabulary, reducing the learning opportunity.

#### **Example 2: High Score (10/10)**  
**User Input:**  
"I forgot to bring my ID card, so the security guard wouldn't let me enter the building."

**Score:** 10/10  

**Score Reasons:**  
- **GOOD:** Used only one standard dictionary form for “to forget,” avoiding redundancy.  
- **GOOD:** Provided an abstract sentence structure without explicit grammar markers or final forms (e.g., 了).  
- **GOOD:** Included complex clues about cause-and-effect, refusal, and measure words without giving away the final sentence.  

**Assistant Output:**  

**Vocabulary Table:**  
| Chinese        | Pinyin     | English          |  
|----------------|------------|------------------|  
| 忘记（忘記）    | wàngjì     | to forget        |  
| 带（帶）        | dài        | to bring/carry   |  
| 身份证（身份證）| shēnfènzhèng | ID card          |  
| 保安           | bǎo'ān     | security guard   |  
| 允许（允許）    | yǔnxǔ      | to permit/allow  |  
| 进（進）        | jìn        | to enter         |  
| 大楼（大樓）    | dàlóu      | building         |  

**Sentence Structure:**  
[Cause] [Subject] [Verb phrase], [Result] [Object/Action].  
*(No tense markers like 了 or verb complements are explicitly provided.)*  

**Clues and Considerations:**  
1. **Cause and Effect:** Use “因为... 所以...” or omit “所以” if the context is clear.  
2. **Refusal:** Consider negative forms like 不允许 or 不让 for “wouldn’t let.”  
3. **Tense:** Decide if 了 is needed after 忘记 to indicate a completed action.  
4. **Building as Location:** Optionally use a measure word (e.g., 这座大楼) or reposition 大楼 for emphasis.  
5. **No Final Punctuation:** Handle conjunctions and punctuation independently.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Construct a cause-and-effect sentence.  
- Request hints if unsure about 了 or negative allowance forms.  
- Compare variations like “保安不让我进” vs. “保安不允许我进去.”
