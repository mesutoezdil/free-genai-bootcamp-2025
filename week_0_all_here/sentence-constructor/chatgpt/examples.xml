      - BAD: Provided the final Chinese sentence outright with all grammar markers.
      - BAD: Used multiple synonyms for "to forget," repeating them in the vocabulary table.
      - BAD: Gave away the placement of 了 (le) and the direct usage of 不让 (would not allow).
      - GOOD: Attempted to show a cause-and-effect structure (“because..., so...”).

      Let’s convert your sentence into Chinese!

      Vocabulary Table:
      | Chinese  | Pinyin  | English       |
      |---------|---------|---------------|
      | (blank) | (blank) | "forgot"      |
      | (blank) | (blank) | "ID card"     |
      | (blank) | (blank) | "security"    |
      | (blank) | (blank) | "enter"       |
      | (blank) | (blank) | "building"    |
      | (blank) | (blank) | "fail to let" |
      | (blank) | (blank) | "forget"      | <!-- repeated synonym -->

      Sentence Structure (problematic):
      [因为] 我 忘记了 带身份证，所以 保安 不让我 进大楼。
      (Here, the system gave a near-complete final sentence with 了, 保安, 不让, etc.)

      Clues:
      - We can say something like “因为... 所以...” for cause-and-effect.
      - It's typical to use 了 after 忘记 to indicate the completed action.
      - We also do “不让” to express the guard’s refusal.

      (Issue: This basically hands out the final solution and duplicates “forget” in the table.)

      - GOOD: Only one standard dictionary form for “to forget,” no repeated synonyms.
      - GOOD: Abstract sentence structure with no explicit grammar markers or final forms (e.g., 了).
      - GOOD: Complex bullet points referencing cause-and-effect, refusal, measure words, but no final sentences.

      Vocabulary Table:
      | Chinese        | Pinyin     | English          |
      |---------------|------------|------------------|
      | 忘记（忘記）    | wàngjì     | to forget        |
      | 带（帶）        | dài        | to bring/carry   |
      | 身份证（身份證）| shēnfènzhèng | ID card          |
      | 保安           | bǎo'ān     | security guard   |
      | 允许（允許）    | yǔnxǔ      | to permit/allow  |
      | 进（進）        | jìn        | to enter         |
      | 大楼（大樓）    | dàlóu      | building         |

      Sentence Structure:
      [Cause] [Subject] [Verb phrase], [Result] [Object/Action].
      (No tense markers like 了 or verb complements spelled out.)

      Clues and Considerations:
      - You have a **cause** (“I forgot my ID card”) and an **effect** (“the guard wouldn't let me enter”).
      - In Chinese, you might choose to use “因为... 所以...” or omit “所以” if the context is clear—but don’t finalize it here.
      - For “wouldn't let me,” consider a negative form of “to allow” (perhaps 不允许), or something that implies refusal (不让). We do not pick the final expression for you.
      - Think about whether you need 了 to indicate a completed action in “forgot.” That’s up to you to decide context.
      - If you want to emphasize the building as a location, you can position 大楼 differently or add a measure word (e.g., 这座大楼) but we’re not specifying it in the structure.
      - No final punctuation or conjunction is explicitly provided. You must handle that yourself.

      Next Steps:
      - Try forming a cause-and-effect sentence. 
      - Ask for hints if you’re unsure about 了 or the negative allowance form.
      - Compare the difference between: “保安不让我进” vs. “保安不允许我进去.”
