      - BAD: Provided fully conjugated forms in the "Sentence Structure" section.
      - BAD: Included multiple near-synonyms for "lose" and "miss" in the vocabulary table, repeating entries.
      - BAD: Gave away some final particles (に, を) and partial final sentence forms.
      - GOOD: Attempted to address multi-clause structure (cause-effect + realization).

      I'll walk you through building this in Japanese. Let's see how we might handle it:

      Vocabulary Table:
      | Japanese | Romaji  | English           |
      |---------|---------|-------------------|
      | パスポート | pasupooto | passport          |
      | 失くす   | nakusu  | to lose           |
      | 学ぶ     | manabu  | to study          |
      | 東京     | Toukyou | Tokyo             |
      | フライト | furaito | flight            |
      | 逃す     | nogasu  | to miss           |
      | 失う     | ushinau | to lose (again)   | <!-- repeated 'lose' synonym -->
      | realize? | ???     | to realize        | <!-- no Japanese provided -->

      Sentence Structure (problematic):
      [Time/Context] [Subject] は [Location] に 勉強しましたが、パスポートを 失くしたことに 気づきました。それで フライトを 逃しました。
      (Here, we used ました forms and even some particles explicitly.)

      Clues and Considerations:
      - "While studying in Tokyo" can use something like [Location] で [Verb stem] ながら, or you might do another approach.
      - Because you realized you had lost your passport, it led to missing your flight. 
      - We can use ことに気づく (to realize a fact) for “realized that I had lost my passport,” but we have basically spelled it out.

      (Overall, we revealed tense and partial final sentence, repeated synonyms, and included particles in the structure, which is not allowed.)

      - GOOD: Only dictionary forms in the vocab table, no repeated synonyms.
      - GOOD: Abstract sentence structure with no tense or particles given away.
      - GOOD: Detailed bullet points for multi-clause usage and cause-effect, without final solutions.
      - GOOD: Encourages advanced expressions like “realizing,” “ending up,” but doesn't finalize the grammar forms.

      Vocabulary Table:
      | Japanese              | Romaji       | English                  |
      |-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
      | 東京（とうきょう）        | Toukyou     | Tokyo                    |
      | 学ぶ（まなぶ）           | manabu      | to study                 |
      | パスポート             | pasupooto   | passport                 |
      | 失くす（なくす）          | nakusu      | to lose                  |
      | 気づく（きづく）          | kidzuku     | to realize (notice)      |
      | フライト               | furaito     | flight                   |
      | 逃す（のがす）           | nogasu      | to miss (an opportunity) |

      Sentence Structure:
      [While/Context] [Subject/Topic] [Action 1], [Realization Clause], [Outcome Verb].
      (No tense, no particles explicitly shown.)

      Clues and Considerations:
      - You have a **time overlap**: “While I was studying.” Consider how Japanese might show simultaneous actions or states.
      - For “I realized I had lost my passport,” think about describing the “lost passport” as a discovery (e.g., 失くしたと...).
      - “Ended up missing my flight” suggests an unwanted outcome—there are expressions in Japanese that imply regret or inevitability (but we don’t give the final form).
      - Particles like に or で may be needed for location or context, but we do **not** list them here.
      - Consider linking these clauses with words that show cause-effect (e.g., から, resulting in missing your flight).
      - Also note the difference between 逃す (to miss an opportunity) vs. 間に合わない (to not make it in time). Both could be relevant, but you can decide which nuance fits best.

      Next Steps:
      - Attempt to form each clause. Don’t forget that “while studying in Tokyo” might be set as a background context (possibly “(Location) で (Verb in stem) ながら” or a similar structure).
      - If you have questions about how to express “I realized,” ask for more clues (like 〜に気づく or 〜ことに気づく).
      - Feel free to ask about nuance differences if you’re unsure of which final expression to use for missing the flight.
